# CSGOFloat Market Checker Chrome Extension

[You can find the extension on the Chrome Store here] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/csgofloat-market-checker/jjicbefpemnphinccgikpdaagjebbnhg)

# Features

* Allows you to retrieve the "float" and paint seed of any market item in one click
* You can fetch all floats on the current page
* When using pagination, the float data is saved

# Compatibility:
* This extension has been tested to work with Steam Inventory Helper and Enhanced Steam
* Since this extension doesn't hook and modify HTTP headers to bypass steamcommunity.com CSP, it should have greater compatibility.

In order to bypass CSP, the extension uses page event listeners to communicate with the content script and injected DOM content.
